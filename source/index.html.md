# Introduction

Welcome to the Kids Health API! You can use our API to access Kids Health API endpoints which provide the latest data on a range of consumption and health metrics for primary school age children across Australia.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, C#, Java, Javascript and Python. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate). Thanks to Robert Lord for creating this awesome tool.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'nuonic'

api = Nuonic::APIClient.authorize!('my-api-key')
```

```python
import nuonic

api = nuonic.authorize('my-api-key')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://api.nuonic.com.au/auth"
  -H "Authorization: my-api-key"
```

```javascript
const nuonic = require('nuonic');

let api = nuonic.authorize('my-api-key');
```

> Make sure to replace `my-api-key` with your API key.

Nuonic APIs use JWT API keys to allow access to the API. You can obtain a Nuonic API key by [signing up ](http://www.nuonic.com.au/signup) for a Nuonic account.

Nuonic expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: my-api-key`

<aside class="notice">
Replace <code>my-api-key</code> with your Nuonic API key.

# Nutrient Profile API

## Summary by location

```ruby
require 'nuonic'

api = Nuonic::APIClient.authorize!('my-api-key')
api.nuonic.get
```

```python
import nuonic

api = nuonic.authorize('my-api-key')
api.nuonic.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://api.nuonic.com.au/kids_health/summary_by_location"
  -H "Authorization: my-api-key"
```

```javascript
const nuonic = require('nuonic');

let api = nuonic.authorize('my-api-key');
let nuonic = api.nuonic.get();
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "number_schools": 1103,
    "number_students": 23847,
    "number_orders": 25738,
    "number_items": 104753,
    "protein_g": 19.23,
    "carbohydrates_g": 26.53,
    "sugar_g": 18.43,
    "sodium_g": 4.54,
    "saturated_fat_g": 23.26,
    "unsaturated_fat_g": 16.34
  }
]
```

This endpoint returns a high-level nutrient consumption profile for a specified time period and location. The profile is an average across all students who transacted (purchased food items) in the period.
